def highest_student_gpa
  "select max(col) from table_name;"
end

def lowest_student_gpa
  "select min(col) from table_name;"
end

def average_student_gpa
  "select avg(col) from table_name;"
end

def total_tardies_for_all_students
  "select sum(col) form table_name;"
end

def average_gpa_for_9th_grade
